## The seven core checks

Applied before any script — SQL or Python — is considered "done":

### 1. Currency

Code uses **current, supported idioms** of the language or SQL dialect. Deprecated patterns are replaced when modern equivalents exist on the deployment target.

**Examples in this repo**

- `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS raw.sales_train;` (SQL Server 2016+ syntax) used in `sql/ddl/01_create_raw_tables.sql`, rather than the pre-2016 `IF OBJECT_ID(...) IS NOT NULL` form
- `pathlib.Path` used throughout Python scripts, not `os.path` string concatenation
- f-strings, never `.format()` or `%s`
- pyodbc 5.x with explicit `autocommit=True` for DDL batches

### 2. Compactness

Concise without sacrificing readability. No clever golf, no unnecessary lines.

**Examples in this repo**

- Single-line list comprehension to filter empty SQL batches: `[b.strip() for b in batches if b.strip()]` instead of a 5-line loop
- Connection strings built once, reused — never duplicated across scripts

### 3. Resource efficiency (cost-aware)

Every script is sized to use the minimum CPU, memory, network, and storage needed. Cloud-cost-aware design from the start, not retrofitted.

**Examples in this repo**

- `WITH (DATA_COMPRESSION = PAGE)` on `raw.sales_train` (~59M rows) and `raw.sell_prices` (~6.8M rows). Estimated 50–70% disk savings — material on the Free Serverless tier's 32 GB cap.
- Column types sized to actual content: `TINYINT` for 0/1 SNAP flags, `SMALLINT` for `year`, `NVARCHAR(5)` for `state_id`. No `BIGINT` or `NVARCHAR(MAX)` where smaller types fit.
- No indexes on raw tables — bulk load runs faster, query-side performance lives in the dbt warehouse layer where it belongs.
- `Connection Timeout=90` tuned to Free Serverless auto-pause behaviour (see `LEARNINGS.md`) — not an arbitrary larger-is-safer default.

### 4. Privacy & security

Secrets externalised, transport encrypted, certificates validated, no sensitive data leaking into logs.

**Examples in this repo**

- All credentials in `.env` (gitignored). `.env.example` committed as a template with placeholder values.
- Every Azure SQL connection uses `Encrypt=yes; TrustServerCertificate=no` — TLS in transit with proper certificate-chain validation.
- Connection timeouts bounded to prevent hanging connections.
- No passwords or PII printed by any script.
- No string-concatenated SQL — zero SQL-injection surface.

### 5. Workflow consistency

Code matches the project's own conventions and the platform conventions of its eventual deployment target.

**Examples in this repo**

- `snake_case` everywhere — tables, columns, scripts, schemas. Matches the Snowflake target (Phase 2) and dbt convention (Phase 4).
- `NVARCHAR` (not `VARCHAR`) for every string column — Unicode-safe, carry-forward from Project #1's encoding lessons.
- `raw` schema in Azure SQL mirrors the planned `RAW` schema in Snowflake — same mental model both sides of the extract.
- File layout: `sql/ddl/` for DDL, `scripts/` for Python — predictable for any reviewer.

### 6. Dev environment hygiene

The local development environment fully validates the code before commit. Linter and type-checker output is treated as signal, not noise — if it's yellow, it gets addressed (fixed, or explicitly suppressed with a documented reason). Drift between "what the linter sees" and "what gets committed" is the same silent-bug class the rest of this checklist exists to prevent.

**Examples in this repo**

- `pyrightconfig.json` at the project root with `extraPaths: ["scripts"]` so Pylance can resolve the DAG-side `import extract_azure_to_snowflake` against the actual module on the host.
- `apache-airflow==2.10.3` installed locally with `--no-deps` so the IDE finds `from airflow.decorators import dag, task` without dragging in Windows-incompatible Unix daemons.
- `# type: ignore` used only as a last resort, with a comment explaining *why* it's there — never to paper over fixable issues.

**How this got here**

Added 2026-05-14, mid-Phase-3-session-1. Yellow squigglies on `airflow/dags/m5_daily_extract.py` surfaced that the original nine criteria all audited the code itself; none covered the environment around it. The checklist evolves when we find gaps — full diagnosis in `LEARNINGS.md`.

### 7. Upstream / downstream contract

Inputs match what the upstream source actually produces (verified, not assumed). Outputs match what downstream consumers expect. No mid-pipeline rework caused by a type mismatch that could have been caught up front.

**Examples in this repo**

- Before writing the loader, CSV headers were inspected directly (`head -1 calendar.csv` etc.) to confirm column names and ordering matched the DDL — no surprises during the load.
- `raw.calendar.d` and `raw.sales_train.d` both `NVARCHAR(10)` — join key types match by design.
- `DECIMAL(10,4)` chosen for `sell_price` rather than `FLOAT` — preserves exact monetary values through pandas → Snowflake → dbt without binary-rounding drift.
- Case-sensitivity differences between Azure SQL (case-insensitive default) and Snowflake (case-sensitive default) flagged ahead of Phase 2 extract design — no surprise on the receiving end.

---

## Three additional failsafes

Layered in by default on every non-trivial script:

### 8. Idempotency

Every script can be re-run after a partial failure without orphaned state or accidental duplicates.

**Examples in this repo**

- DDL uses drop-and-recreate — `sql/ddl/01_create_raw_tables.sql` is safe to re-run during schema iteration.
- (Phase 1 loader, in progress) Will TRUNCATE-then-INSERT for each table — a failed mid-run leaves zero ghost rows.

### 9. Pre-flight and post-action verification

Validate assumptions before destructive work. Confirm the outcome after.

**Examples in this repo**

- `scripts/smoke_test_azure_sql.py` proves the full connection stack (pyodbc → ODBC Driver 17 → TLS → firewall → Azure SQL auth) before any data work begins.
- `Test-NetConnection ... -Port 1433` used as a network-only diagnostic to distinguish firewall failures from login-layer failures.
- `scripts/load_m5_to_azure_sql.py` compares actual row counts against expected values post-load — raises `ValueError` on any mismatch.
- `sql/verify/01_phase1_load_verification.sql` — a separate, version-controlled SQL file containing the 5-section verification suite for Phase 1 (row counts, schema, sample rows). Standalone artefact you can re-run any time, not just at load time.

**Caveat from Phase 1 (what *not* to do):**

The loader's `EXPECTED_ROWS` constant for `sales_train` was a hardcoded magic number — and it was wrong by 1,000. Result: an 11-hour load that completed correctly but exited with a false `MISMATCH` alarm. The verification *logic* was perfect; the *expected baseline* was wrong.

**Lesson:** verifying the SHAPE of a calculation is not verifying the PRODUCT. When a magic number guards verification, compute it via two independent routes (Python arithmetic AND `SELECT 30490 * 1941` in SQL), or — better — derive the expected value from runtime measurements instead of hardcoding. The full diagnosis is in `LEARNINGS.md` under *Mistakes & diagnoses*.

### 10. Observable progress and actionable errors

Long-running operations report what they are doing. Failures surface specifics, not raw tracebacks.

**Examples in this repo**

- Both Python scripts print batch-by-batch progress (`Batch 3/5: CREATE TABLE raw.sell_prices...`).
- The connect step explicitly warns about Free Serverless auto-pause: *"If the database has auto-paused, the first connect may take 30–60 seconds..."* — operator knows it's not frozen.

## Phase-boundary structural audit

Beyond the per-script 10-point audit, a structural pass is applied at each
**phase or layer boundary** — before a phase is declared "done" and before
the next phase begins. The per-script audit verifies that individual files
meet the bar; the structural audit verifies that the project **as a
collection** is consistent, complete, and free of drift.

### Why this exists

The per-script audit can miss issues that only appear in aggregate:

- **Naming collisions** — two files in the same folder sharing a numeric
  prefix (e.g. two `04_*.sql` verify files). Each file is fine on its own;
  together they break monotonic ordering.
- **Stale scaffolding** — `.gitkeep` placeholders left behind after their
  folders gained real files. Each individual `.gitkeep` is harmless; the
  pattern across the project is redundant noise.
- **Missing pairings** — a `.sql` model without its schema-YAML entry; a
  verify file whose model has been renamed; a test referencing a column that
  no longer exists.
- **Test-count drift** — schema YAMLs and the actual `dbt build` test count
  diverge silently when models are added or refactored without updating
  tests.

The cheapest place to catch these is at the **end of each phase**, before
documentation closeout and before the bundled commit lands.

### What to check

| Check | Question |
| --- | --- |
| File inventory | All expected files present (`.sql`, schema YAML, sources, verify, walkthrough)? |
| Naming monotonicity | File prefixes order monotonically; no collisions? |
| Scaffolding cleanup | `.gitkeep` only in folders that are still empty? |
| Pairings | Every model has a schema entry; every verify file has a live model |
| Test-count parity | Schema-YAML test count matches `dbt build` test count |
| Doc currency | Walkthrough doc covers every model in the layer; PROJECT_CONTEXT's file lists are accurate |

### When to run

- At the **end of each phase session** that ships meaningful structure
  (Phase 1 load layer, Phase 2 extract layer, Phase 3 DAG layer, Phase 4
  each dbt layer, etc.)
- **Before** drafting closeout docs — findings can be fixed in-session
  rather than back-and-forth'd in a follow-up commit
- **Before** the bundled commit — keeps the commit a clean snapshot, not
  a mix of work + retrospective cleanup

### How

A quick `Glob` or `ls -1` over the relevant folders enumerates files; a
mental walk-through against the checklist above surfaces drift. Fixes
applied in-session, then proceed to docs + commit.

### First explicit application: Phase 4 session 4 (2026-05-16)

Caught two issues that would otherwise have been frozen into the session
commit:

1. `04_phase4_int_sales_with_prices_verification.sql` collided with
   `04_phase4_staging_layer_verification.sql` — both prefixed `04_`. Renamed
   the intermediate one to `04a_` to preserve monotonic ordering without
   renumbering downstream verify files.
2. Three stale `.gitkeep` placeholders still in `staging/` /
   `intermediate/` / `warehouse/` model folders despite those folders
   now containing real models. Removed; only `marts/.gitkeep` remains
   pending session 5.

Both were 30-second fixes once caught. The cost of catching them
post-commit would have been a rebase or a follow-up "fix" commit — more
disruptive, worse history. The audit paid for itself on its first run.

### Phase 6 audit (2026-05-22) — v1.0 ship gate

Three new files shipped at Phase 6 close. Each passed all 10 criteria; results banked below for v1.0 release notes.

**`.github/workflows/lint-python.yml`** — ruff F821 CI gate.

- Currency: actions/checkout@v4 + actions/setup-python@v5 (latest stable as of May 2026); Python 3.11 baseline matches local venv.
- Compactness: 30 lines; comments explain why F821-only scope is correct (full ruff is gold-plating).
- Resource efficiency: lint runs in milliseconds; no Docker pull, no DB connection.
- Privacy & security: no secrets needed, no credentials referenced.
- Workflow consistency: kebab-case workflow filename matches the sibling dbt-ci.yml.
- Dev environment hygiene: Python version pinned; pip install ruff without version pin is acceptable for a single-rule check.
- Upstream/downstream contract: F821 catches exactly the class of bug surfaced at 5.9 (`mart_rows` stale variable reference). Defense-in-depth, not primary defence.
- Idempotency: re-runs are safe; lint is read-only.
- Pre-flight + post-action verification: the workflow IS the pre-flight verification step for every PR.
- Observable progress + actionable errors: ruff outputs `file:line:col` for each finding, directly actionable.

**`.github/workflows/dbt-ci.yml`** — dbt parse + sqlfluff lint.

- Currency: dbt-core 1.11.10 + dbt-snowflake 1.11.5 pins match `requirements.txt` exactly; sqlfluff >=3.0.0 modern.
- Compactness: two-job workflow; inline comment block explains why `dbt test` is deliberately excluded from CI (cost avoidance on pay-as-you-go Snowflake).
- Resource efficiency: `paths:` filter limits runs to `dbt/**` changes — no wasted CI minutes on README-only commits.
- Privacy & security: dummy env vars in the job (not real secrets); `dbt parse` doesn't connect to Snowflake.
- Workflow consistency: matches sibling lint-python.yml style and conventions.
- Dev environment hygiene: pins exactly match `requirements.txt`; `defaults.run.working-directory: dbt` removes path duplication.
- Upstream/downstream contract: matches dbt-snowflake adapter version the project ships with.
- Idempotency: re-runs safe.
- Pre-flight + post-action verification: dbt parse catches Jinja / ref / source errors; sqlfluff catches SQL style drift.
- Observable progress + actionable errors: both tools emit file:line errors with rule codes; failures point directly at the offending model.

**`dbt/.sqlfluff`** — Snowflake-dialect lint config.

- Currency: snowflake dialect + jinja templater are sqlfluff's current canonical names; `apply_dbt_builtins = true` enables `ref()` / `source()` / `var()` macro recognition.
- Compactness: 30 lines; every section commented; each rule exclusion individually rationalised inline.
- Resource efficiency: no DB connection required for lint; runs entirely on local templating.
- Privacy & security: no secrets in config; no credentials referenced.
- Workflow consistency: keyword case `upper` matches the project's explicit SQL preference from TEACHING_PREFERENCES.md; identifier case `lower` matches dbt model source code; type/function/literal cases match conventional Snowflake style.
- Dev environment hygiene: 120-char line length accommodates typical dbt-generated SQL without forcing artificial wrapping.
- Upstream/downstream contract: dialect matches what the dbt project actually emits.
- Idempotency: configuration is declarative; same input → same output every run.
- Pre-flight + post-action verification: this config IS the gate sqlfluff uses for lint verification.
- Observable progress + actionable errors: rule exclusions documented explain WHY each is off, so future engineers can re-enable confidently.

**No findings to fix at Phase 6 audit.** The Phase 4 audit caught 2 issues; this Phase 6 audit caught 0. Different file class — Phase 4 was author-time SQL + Python scripts where ordering / placeholder management could drift; Phase 6 is single-purpose CI declarations where the entire surface is small and reviewable in one pass. Net: 10-criteria checklist proven applicable across both file classes.

**v1.0.1 patch (2026-05-22 later) — supersedes two of the Phase 6 audit bullets:**

The Phase 6 audit above passed the CI config as shipped, but the first CI run after pushing v1.0 failed. Two bullets above are now historically accurate but operationally stale, superseded as follows:

- **`.github/workflows/dbt-ci.yml` Privacy & security bullet (line 234) supersession.** The sqlfluff-lint job no longer uses dummy env vars — it uses 7 encrypted GitHub Actions Secrets (SNOWFLAKE_* values from local `.env`). The dbt-parse job still uses dummy creds (dbt parse doesn't connect). Mixed-credentials approach is documented in the workflow header comment.
- **`dbt/.sqlfluff` Currency + Resource efficiency bullets (lines 244, 246) supersession.** Templater switched from `jinja` to `dbt` because the jinja templater + `apply_dbt_builtins = true` resolves dbt-core macros (ref / source / var) but NOT package macros (anything namespaced like `dbt_utils.*`). Project #2 uses `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key()` in 5 models, so the dbt templater is structurally required. The dbt templater calls `dbt compile` which initializes the Snowflake adapter and validates the connection — meaning lint DOES now require warehouse connectivity, contrary to the original "no DB connection required" claim. Net change: heavier CI (~30s extra to install dbt + dbt deps), more dependencies, but the lint actually works against package-macro-using SQL.

**Audit takeaway from the patch:** the Phase 6 audit was correct on the criteria it tested (the bullets all held at audit time), but missed a CROSS-CONFIG INTERACTION — the .sqlfluff templater choice depended on the .sql model contents not using any package macros, an unspoken assumption that broke as soon as CI actually ran against real model files. Carry-forward criterion candidate: **"Cross-file dependency check"** — verify that config files A and B agree on the assumptions each makes about the other, before declaring either passes audit. Banked for Project #3 Phase 0. Full saga in `LEARNINGS.md` under "2026-05-22 (later) — v1.0.1 patch".

## Why this checklist exists

In any production pipeline, the most expensive defects are the ones caught **after** code has been deployed and data has flowed: re-loads, schema migrations, downstream model rewrites, broken dashboards, stakeholder emails. The checklist is upfront discipline aimed at moving as many of those decisions as possible into **first-pass authoring** — when the cost of changing a column type or compression setting is one edit, not a rollback.

The structure of this project is deliberately documentation-heavy in support of this principle:

- `PROJECT_PLAN.md` — locks scope and decisions up front
- `LEARNINGS.md` — captures every "diagnosis → fix → what this taught me" loop
- `CODE_QUALITY.md` *(this file)* — the bar every script is held to
- `TEACHING_PREFERENCES.md` — how I work with AI tooling that helps enforce all of the above
