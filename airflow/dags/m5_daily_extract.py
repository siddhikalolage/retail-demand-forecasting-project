"""
m5_daily_extract -- the first DAG in the retail-demand-forecasting pipeline.

Wraps scripts/extract_azure_to_snowflake.py as a single Airflow task. Each
scheduled run extracts ONE day's worth of M5 data from Azure SQL into
Snowflake -- the "simulated freshness via date-partitioned extraction"
pattern locked in PROJECT_CONTEXT.md.

DAG anatomy at a glance:
    schedule:          None        (manual-trigger-only; portfolio-demo DAG --
                                    no auto-firing on unpause. To run a date,
                                    "Trigger DAG w/ config" and set logical
                                    date. Locked 2026-05-22 in session 5.9
                                    after the @daily schedule auto-triggered
                                    a today's-date run on unpause.)
    start_date:        2014-01-01  (the day after the 3-year backfill ends;
                                    retained for run-history continuity)
    catchup:           False       (redundant with schedule=None but kept
                                    explicit so the no-backfill intent reads
                                    clearly from the DAG body)
    retries:           2           (Airflow-level backstop; script-level
                                    retry-on-40613 handles the common case)
    retry_delay:       60s
    max_active_runs:   1           (no parallel runs -- they'd contend on the
                                    same DELETE+INSERT window in Snowflake)

The script-level wake_azure_sql() helper absorbs Azure SQL's cold-start
40613/40197 errors so each Airflow task attempt doesn't get burned just
because the DB took 45s to wake. retries=2 here is a true backstop, for
genuinely-unexpected failures: a network hiccup, a transient pyodbc
disconnect mid-stream, etc.
