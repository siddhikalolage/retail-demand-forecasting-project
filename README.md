# retail-demand-forecasting-project

> A cloud-native retail demand-planning and forecasting platform. Walmart M5 historical
> sales data ingested from Azure SQL Database into Snowflake via orchestrated Airflow DAGs,
> transformed through a Kimball star schema with dedicated analytical marts in dbt,
> forecast with Snowflake Cortex machine learning, and surfaced as a five-page Power BI
> dashboard for supply chain planning and operational decision-making.

**Status: COMPLETE — 2026-05-22.** End-to-end and interview-ready: Azure SQL Database → Snowflake `RAW` → dbt `STAGING` / `INTERMEDIATE` / `WAREHOUSE` / `MARTS` → Snowflake Cortex ML forecast → five-page Power BI dashboard, orchestrated on an Apache Airflow (Docker) DAG with per-model lineage via Astronomer Cosmos. Full Kimball star schema (incremental `fact_daily_sales` at 32.9M rows / $100.7M revenue), two pre-aggregated marts, a 28-day Cortex forecast for ~3K items conformed into the warehouse star and UNIONed with actuals, plus GitHub Actions CI (`dbt parse` + `sqlfluff` + `ruff` F821). Full build history, design decisions and the lessons log live in `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` and `LEARNINGS.md`.

## What this project demonstrates

- **End-to-end pipeline** from an operational source database (Azure SQL) to a BI dashboard
- **Cloud warehouse** (Snowflake) fed from a **cloud-hosted OLTP source** (Azure SQL Database) — the realistic enterprise pattern of a relational ERP / Microsoft Dynamics-style source → cloud warehouse → BI tool
- **Orchestrated execution** via Apache Airflow (Docker), with independent Snowflake-side verification tasks that catch silent failures inside the DAG
- **Per-model dbt lineage in Airflow** via Astronomer Cosmos — Cosmos parses the dbt project at DAG-parse time and generates one Airflow task per dbt model and per test, so the Graph view shows the dbt DAG directly and a failing model surfaces as a single red task linked to its dbt logs
- **Production-grade dbt** with `dbt_utils`, tests, packages, partitioned incremental fact models, and a lean marts layer (pre-aggregations where they earn their keep; the warehouse star otherwise exposed directly to BI)
- **Kimball star schema at scale, by design** — deliberately dimensional modelling using the time-tested Kimball approach for star-schema analytics; the M5 dataset (~58M daily-sales rows across 30,000 SKUs and 10 stores) makes partitioning, incremental loads and pre-aggregated marts genuinely necessary rather than ceremonial
- **Time-series forecasting layer** — a Snowflake Cortex 28-day forecast conformed into the warehouse star (`fact_forecast_daily`) and joined to actuals via a dedicated `mart_forecast_vs_actual` model, surfacing the headline business question on the dashboard ("how is reality tracking against the forecast?") with full lineage back through the pipeline
- **Five-page Power BI dashboard** — Executive Overview, Demand by Hierarchy, Promotion & Price, Seasonality & Calendar, Forecast vs Actual
- **GitHub Actions CI** — `dbt parse` + `sqlfluff` lint + `ruff` F821 Python lint on every push and PR (`dbt test` deliberately run locally to avoid burning pay-as-you-go Snowflake credits)

## Implementation approach

This project was built with the following principles:

- **Intentional design** — every component serves a clear purpose; no gold-plating or
  over-engineering for its own sake.
- **Transparent decisions** — why this technology, why this pattern? Documented in
  `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` and `LEARNINGS.md`.
- **Production patterns** — the architecture mirrors real enterprise data platforms,
  scaled to a single-developer portfolio scope.
- **Complete testing** — end-to-end smoke tests, dbt tests, SQL validation, and CI checks
  ensure the pipeline is reproducible and robust.

- `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` — running session state + full build history
- `EXTRACT_PIPELINE.md` / `DBT_PIPELINE.md` / `POWERBI_PIPELINE.md` — layer-by-layer walkthroughs

- `POWERBI_PLAYBOOK.md` — Power BI build playbook (storage modes, measures, page polish)
- `GLOSSARY.md` — project terminology
- `LEARNING_ROADMAP.md` — feature roadmap and phased development milestones
- `LEARNINGS.md` — diagnosis → fix → lesson loops across SQL, Snowflake, Python, dbt, Airflow, Power BI and CI
- `BUSINESS_INSIGHTS.md` — analytical findings, KPI definitions, and business recommendations

## Dashboard

Five interactive pages built in Power BI Desktop on the dbt marts in Snowflake.
Import storage mode — the `.pbix` file opens standalone for reviewers, no Snowflake
connection required (all data baked into the file). Location: `powerbi/retail_demand_forecasting.pbix`.

**Forecast accuracy note:** The Cortex forecasts shown on the "Forecast vs Actual" page
are 28-day rolling predictions conformed to the warehouse schema and evaluated against
the actual M5 sales data. See `BUSINESS_INSIGHTS.md` for forecast performance metrics
by product category and segment.

### Executive Overview

![Executive Overview](powerbi/screenshots/executive_overview.png)

Top-of-funnel KPIs across the M5 dataset (Revenue, Units Sold, Stores, SKUs) plus
a daily revenue trend with a dashed 30-day moving-average overlay. The landing
page — headline numbers and the long-term shape of the business in one glance.

### Demand by Hierarchy

![Demand by Hierarchy](powerbi/screenshots/demand_by_hierarchy.png)

Revenue cuts across the category → department → item hierarchy. The bar charts set
the FOODS / HOUSEHOLD / HOBBIES split (FOODS dominates at $60M / 59% of revenue);
the matrix drills into department-level share; the Top 10 Items table confirms the
classic retail long-tail — even the top 10 SKUs concentrate only ~5.7% of total
revenue.

### Promotion & Price

![Promotion & Price](powerbi/screenshots/promotion_and_price.png)

Price-elasticity and SNAP-day story. Average selling price by category (HOUSEHOLD
highest, FOODS lowest); the donut shows SNAP-benefit days drive 52% of revenue from
~33% of calendar days; the scatter exposes FOODS_3 as the cheap-price / high-volume
outlier — classic price-elasticity in one chart.

### Seasonality & Calendar

![Seasonality & Calendar](powerbi/screenshots/seasonality_and_calendar.png)

Calendar effects on demand. Weekday vs Weekend bars show weekend revenue
over-indexes ~33% per day; the Holiday Events bar surfaces SuperBowl as the
strongest single-day uplift; the Year × Month heatmap (green sequential gradient)
makes year-on-year revenue growth legible across the 2011-2014 history (~50% lift
from 2011 to 2013).

### Forecast vs Actual

![Forecast vs Actual](powerbi/screenshots/forecast_vs_actual.png)

Where the project's ML layer lands in the dashboard. Forecast Revenue and Forecast
Units KPI cards top-right; the Revenue and Units line charts show actuals (solid
green) plus dbt-produced Cortex forecasts (dashed red), with 95% confidence
intervals (dotted) on the Units chart; the matrix at the bottom splits actual vs
forecast by category.

## Building this project

This project demonstrates a complete, production-grade data platform for retail analytics and forecasting.
It is designed to be:

- **End-to-end and self-contained** — every component integrated and tested together
- **Interview-ready** — architecture, decisions, and learnings documented transparently
- **Extensible** — patterns and structure support both immediate use and future platform growth

Full design decisions, technical walkthroughs, and lessons learned are documented in the project files:
`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `LEARNINGS.md`, and the layer-specific `*_PIPELINE.md` guides.
