-- Source-side row-count verification for Phase 2's Azure SQL -> Snowflake
-- backfill (window: 2011-01-29 -> 2013-12-31, inclusive).
--
-- Each query computes what scripts/extract_azure_to_snowflake.py SHOULD have
-- pulled out of Azure SQL for the 3-year window. Run alongside the
-- Snowflake-side check in sql/snowflake/02_extract_smoke_tests.sql Section 5
-- to prove end-to-end parity:  Azure SQL count  ==  Snowflake count.
--
-- Run in Azure Data Studio, VS Code mssql extension, or the Azure portal
-- Query editor. Connect as sqladmin to YOUR_AZURE_SQL_DATABASE.

-- Phase: 2 — Snowflake + extraction
-- Created: 2026-05-14 (Phase 2 session 3 — backfill closeout)

-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Section 1 — Source-side row counts for the 3-year backfill window.
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- These mirror the filters the extract script applies at runtime:
--   calendar    -> WHERE [date] BETWEEN start AND end
--   sell_prices -> WHERE wm_yr_wk IN (distinct weeks inside window)
--   sales_train -> WHERE d IN (d codes mapping to dates inside window)
--
-- If these counts match the destination counts in Snowflake (Section 5 of
-- sql/snowflake/02_extract_smoke_tests.sql), backfill parity is proven.

ORDER BY table_name;

-- Expected output:
--   table_name  | row_count   | expected    | status
--   ------------+-------------+-------------+--------
--   calendar    | 1,068       | 1,068       | OK
--   sales_train | 32,563,320  | 32,563,320  | OK
--   sell_prices | 3,040,105   | 3,040,105   | OK
--
-- Note: COUNT_BIG(*) returns BIGINT. Used defensively even though our counts
-- are well under the 2.1B INT limit -- same habit established in
-- sql/verify/01_phase1_load_verification.sql.

-- Section 2 — Spot-check a single date inside the window.
-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Useful if Section 1 shows MISMATCH and you want to drill in. Picks a date
-- in the middle of the window (2012-06-15) and confirms the day-level row
-- count for sales_train is exactly 30,490 (one row per item-store series).

-- Expected:
--   d        | date       | rows_for_date
--   ---------+------------+---------------
--   d_<N>    | 2012-06-15 | 30,490
