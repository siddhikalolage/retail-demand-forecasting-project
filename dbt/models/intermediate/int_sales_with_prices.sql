-- int_sales_with_prices.sql
-- Joins daily sales to weekly prices and computes revenue.
-- Grain: one row per (store_id, item_id, sale_date).
-- LEFT JOIN to prices preserves sales rows that have no matching price;
-- revenue_amount_usd is NULL in that case ("price unknown", not "zero revenue").
-- See DBT_PIPELINE.md for the full walkthrough.
