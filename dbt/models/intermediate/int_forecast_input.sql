-- int_forecast_input.sql
-- Slim historical view that feeds Snowflake Cortex ML FORECAST.
-- Grain: one row per (item × day). Units aggregated across all stores per item.
-- ~3,049 series × ~1,150 days = ~3.4M training rows.
--
-- Design choice — item-level grain (not item × store):
--   Aggregating units across stores produces stronger signal per series because
--   each item's daily demand across all 10 stores is more stationary than per-store
--   splits. Standard retail forecasting pattern when stores share similar SKU mixes.
--   Trains in ~3-5 min on XS warehouse vs ~2-5 hrs at item × store grain.
