-- dim_calendar.sql
-- Calendar dimension. One row per date.
-- Materialised as table (per dbt_project.yml warehouse default).
-- Surrogate key via dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key for consistency with other dims.
-- ISO date variants (DAYOFWEEKISO, WEEKISO) used for session-parameter independence.
--
-- Coverage: historical M5 dates from stg_m5_calendar PLUS a 60-day future
-- horizon to support forecast date slicing in Power BI (Forecast vs Actual
-- page joins forecast.date_key → dim_calendar.date_key). Future rows carry
-- date-derived attributes only; M5-specific attrs (d, wm_yr_wk, event_*,
-- snap_*) are NULL — see _warehouse__models.yml tests scoped historical-only.
-- See DBT_PIPELINE.md for the full walkthrough.
